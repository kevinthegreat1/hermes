    This documentation is incomplete while we are migrating from our internal documentation store to the public GitHub.

## Installing the Hermes data source plugin

The Hermes data source plugin is distributed as a release asset on GitHub. If you are using the default [docker compose](https://github.com/nasa/hermes/blob/main/docker-compose.yml), the plugin is pre-installed with a pinned version, and no action is needed. Otherwise, you need to install the plugin following the steps below. Because it is **unsigned**, Grafana must be configured to allow it in addition to installing the files.

After [allowing the unsigned plugin](#allowing-the-unsigned-plugin), pick the method that matches your setup:

- **[Install to Docker Compose](#install-to-docker-compose)** — use Grafana's built-in plugin installer with a pinned version (**recommended**).
- **[Install to an existing Grafana instance](#install-to-an-existing-grafana-instance)** — run the install script to get the latest release.
- **[Install to a single Docker container](#install-to-a-single-docker-container)** — mount a host directory.

### Allowing the Unsigned Plugin

Grafana will not load the plugin unless it is explicitly allowed. Use whichever
applies to your setup:

- **Environment variable** (used in the Docker examples below):

    ```bash
    GF_PLUGINS_ALLOW_LOADING_UNSIGNED_PLUGINS=nasa-hermes-datasource
    ```

- **`grafana.ini`** under `[plugins]`:

    ```ini
    [plugins]
    allow_loading_unsigned_plugins = nasa-hermes-datasource
    ```

Restart Grafana after changing `grafana.ini`.

### Install to Docker Compose

**This is the recommended approach.** Use Grafana's built-in `GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS` environment variable to install a specific pinned version of the plugin. This is the approach used in the default [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/nasa/hermes/blob/main/docker-compose.yml):

```yaml
services:
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS: "https://github.com/nasa/hermes/releases/download/v5.0.0/nasa-hermes-datasource-5.0.0.zip;nasa-hermes-datasource"
      GF_PLUGINS_ALLOW_LOADING_UNSIGNED_PLUGINS: "nasa-hermes-datasource"
    volumes:
      - grafana-data:/var/lib/grafana

volumes:
  grafana-data:
```

The plugin is downloaded and installed automatically when the container starts. To upgrade to a newer version, update the release URL in `GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS` to point to the desired version from the [releases page](https://github.com/nasa/hermes/releases) and recreate the container.

### Install to an Existing Grafana Instance

The install script downloads the latest published release and extracts it into
your Grafana plugins directory. It requires [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/).

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nasa/hermes/main/grafana-datasource-plugin/install.sh | bash
```

The script auto-detects a plugins directory. To install into a specific directory,
pass it as an argument (everything after `bash -s --` is passed to the script):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nasa/hermes/main/grafana-datasource-plugin/install.sh \
  | bash -s -- /var/lib/grafana/plugins
```

The plugin is installed to `<plugins-dir>/nasa-hermes-datasource/`. Then
[allow the unsigned plugin](#allowing-the-unsigned-plugin) and restart Grafana.

### Install to a Single Docker Container

Install the plugin into a host folder, then mount it into the container:

```bash
# Install the plugin into a host folder
mkdir -p ~/grafana-plugins
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nasa/hermes/main/grafana-datasource-plugin/install.sh \
  | bash -s -- ~/grafana-plugins

# Start Grafana with the plugin mounted and allowed
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  -e GF_PLUGINS_ALLOW_LOADING_UNSIGNED_PLUGINS=nasa-hermes-datasource \
  -v ~/grafana-plugins:/var/lib/grafana/plugins \
  --name grafana grafana/grafana:latest
```

### Verifying the installation

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (default login `admin` /
`admin`), then navigate to **Administration → Plugins and data → Plugins** and
search for **hermes**. The **Hermes** data source should appear in the list, marked
as an unsigned plugin.

If it does not appear, confirm the plugin was extracted into the correct plugins
directory and that [unsigned plugins are allowed](#allowing-the-unsigned-plugin).
